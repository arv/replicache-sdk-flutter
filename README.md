# Replicache Flutter SDK

![Flutter Test](https://github.com/rocicorp/replicache-sdk-flutter/workflows/Flutter%20Test/badge.svg)

# Quickstart

Hi! This tutorial walks through creating a basic offline-first todo app in Flutter with Replicache.

If you have any problems working through this, or just have questions, please [join us on Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/rocicorp/shared_invite/zt-ekh3oxbq-FzzB7qP9lwqdTvBjxXU2oA). We'd be happy to help.

**Note:** This document assumes you already know what Replicache is, why you might need it, and broadly how it works. If that's not true, see the [Replicache homepage](https://replicache.dev) for an overview, or the [design document](https://github.com/rocicorp/replicache/blob/master/design.md) for a detailed deep-dive.

### 1. Get the SDK

Download and unzip the latest SDK release:

```bash
curl -o replicache-sdk-flutter.zip -L https://github.com/rocicorp/replicache-sdk-flutter/releases/latest/download/replicache-sdk-flutter.zip
unzip replicache-sdk-flutter.zip
```

### 2. Start a new, empty Flutter app

```bash
flutter create todo
```

### 3. Add the `replicache` dependency to your Flutter app's `pubspec.yaml`

Add the following lines to the `dependencies` section of `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
  replicache:
    path:
      /path/to/replicache-sdk-flutter/
```

### 4. Add main.dart

Replace the contents of `main.dart` with the following:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:replicache/replicache.dart';
import 'dart:io';
import 'dart:math';

void main() => runApp(MyApp());

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  final String _title = 'Replicache Demo';

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: _title,
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(title: _title),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  // Android emulator cannot use localhost.
  final diffsURL = 'http://${Platform.isAndroid ? '10.0.2.2' : 'localhost'}:7001/pull';

  // You authenticate to the diff server with your account ID. To play around, use 'sandbox'.
  final diffsAuth = 'sandbox';

  final String title;
  final _random = Random();
  Replicache _replicache;
  Mutator _createTodo;

  MyHomePage({Key key, this.title}) : super(key: key) {
    _replicache = Replicache(
      diffServerUrl: diffsURL,
      diffServerAuth: diffsAuth,
    );

    // Tell Replicache to pull from the diff server every 10s. In a real app you'll have this be
    // far less frequent and typically pull only in response to a server push notification.  But
    // this is convenient for development.
    _replicache.syncInterval = Duration(seconds: 10);

    _createTodo = _replicache.register("createTodo", (tx, args) async {
      tx.put("/todo/${args["id"]}", args);
    });
  }

  void _handleAddTodo() {
    var id = _random.nextInt(2^32-1);
    _createTodo({"id": id, "text": "Todo $id", "order": 1.0, "complete": false});
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text(title),
        actions: <Widget>[
          IconButton(
            icon: const Icon(Icons.add),
            tooltip: 'Add Todo',
            onPressed: () {
              _handleAddTodo();
            },
          ),
        ],
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: StreamBuilder(
          stream: _replicache.subscribe((ReadTransaction tx) async {
            Iterable<ScanItem> res = await tx.scan(prefix: '/todo/');
            return res.map((event) => event.value as Map<String, dynamic>);
          }),
          builder:  (BuildContext context, AsyncSnapshot<Iterable<Map<String, dynamic>>> snapshot) {
            return Column(
              mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.start,
              crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,
              children: List.from(
                (snapshot.data ?? []).map(
                  (Map m) => CheckboxListTile(value: m['complete'], title: Text(m['text'])))),
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Now launch the Flutter app:

```bash
cd todo
flutter pub get
flutter emulators --launch apple_ios_simulator
flutter run
```

The app starts up, but there's no TODOs yet:

[todo: image]()

In the console, you will see output like:

```
flutter: Replicache (native): 02 Jun 20 13:53:31.000 -1000 INF Opened Replicache instance at: /Users/aa/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices/66A73307-D0C6-4D9A-87A4-B2664A3F13CA/data/Containers/Data/Application/4FD702A2-84E8-4D47-82D6-F804702481F5/Library/Application Support/com.example.todo/replicache/aHR0cDovL2xvY2FsaG9zdDo3MDAxL3B1bGw with tempdir: /Users/aa/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices/66A73307-D0C6-4D9A-87A4-B2664A3F13CA/data/Containers/Data/Application/4FD702A2-84E8-4D47-82D6-F804702481F5/tmp and ClientID: o3mMfS36gUrMkw3jfoNWun db=http://localhost:7001/pull gr=17 req=open rid=1
flutter: Replicache: LogLevel.info: Error: Exception: Error invoking "beginSync": PlatformException(UNAVAILABLE, sync o3mMfS36gUrMkw3jfoNWun-5ed6e67b-1 failed: pull from http://localhost:7001/pull failed: Post "http://localhost:7001/pull": dial tcp [::1]:7001: connect: connection refused, null)
```

Replicache starts up and tries to do an initial sync, but fails because no diff-server is running. That's OK! We'll fix that in the next step.

For now, search for `ClientID` in the console output and copy it down. Every device syncing with Replicache has a unique `ClientID` generated at first run. We'll need that value next.


### 5. Start a development diff-server and put some data in it:

In a new console, download a copy of the development diff-server:

```bash
# For OSX
curl -o diffs -L https://github.com/rocicorp/diff-server/releases/latest/download/diffs-osx
chmod u+x diffs

# For Linux
curl -o diffs -L https://github.com/rocicorp/diff-server/releases/latest/download/diffs-linux
chmod u+x diffs
```

*(Note: You'll probably want to put `diffs` in your path somewhere as you'll be using it frequently.)*

Start `diffs` and leave it running:

```bash
/path/to/diffs --db=/tmp/foo serve --enable-inject
```

Then, in a third console, inject a snapshot into the diff server:

```bash
CLIENT_ID=<your-client-id-from-step-4>
curl -d @- http://localhost:7001/inject << EOF
{
  "accountID": "sandbox",
  "clientID": "$CLIENT_ID",
  "clientViewResponse": {
    "clientView": {
      "/list/29597": {
        "id": 29597,
        "ownerUserID": 3
      },
      "/todo/14136": {
        "complete": false,
        "id": 14136,
        "listId": 29597,
        "order": 0.5,
        "text": "Take out the trash"
      },
      "lastTransactionID":"0"
    }
  }
}
EOF
```

The new todo shows up on next sync:

Sweet!

#### Notes:

* We set a relatively frequent sync interval during development. For production applications, we recommend leaving this the default (1 minute) and syncing primarily in response to a server push. Most applications have to send such pushes anyway, e.g., to display notifications to the user.
* The `accountID` is your unique account ID on diff-server. During our early alpha testing, use `"sandbox"`.
* To get the `clientID` value search the log output of the Flutter app for `ClientID`. Replicache prints it out early in startup.
* You'll setup `lastTransactionID` later in this tutorial. For now just return `0`.

### 6. Update Data

Now inject a new snapshot:

```bash
curl -d @- http://localhost:7001/inject << EOF
{
  "accountID": "sandbox",
  "clientID": "$CLIENT_ID",
  "clientViewResponse": {
    "clientView": {
      "/list/29597": {
        "id": 29597,
        "ownerUserID": 3
      },
      "/todo/14136": {
        "complete": true,
        "id": 14136,
        "listId": 29597,
        "order": 0.5,
        "text": "Take out the trash"
      },
      "/todo/9081": {
        "complete": false,
        "id": 9081,
        "listId": 29597,
        "order": 0.75,
        "text": "Walk the dog"
      },
      "lastTransactionID":"0"
    }
  }
}
EOF
```

You'll see your Flutter app update dynamically:

Huzzah!

### 7. Write Data

Add a Todo by pressing the "+" button in the top-right corner of the app. The change happens immediately and updates in the app:

### 8. ðŸŽ‰

Congratulations â€” you are done with the client setup! Time for a cup of coffee.

In fact, while you're away, why not turn off the wifi and click around. Your app will respond instantly with cached data and queue up the changes to replay, once you setup the server-side integration.

## Next steps

- Implement the [server-side of Replicache integration](https://github.com/rocicorp/replicache/)
- See [`flutter/redo`](https://github.com/rocicorp/replicache-sdk-flutter/tree/master/sample/redo) a fully functioning TODO app built on Flutter and Replicache
- Review the [Replicache Dart Reference](https://replicache-sdk-flutter.now.sh/)
- Inspect your Replicache databases using [the `repl` tool](https://github.com/rocicorp/replicache-server/blob/master/doc/cli.md)
